This is the perfect next step. Since you want this material to be easily transferable to visual tools like Figma, Sketch, or Canva, I will provide a **detailed, prescriptive wireframe specification** for each slide.

This guidance focuses on layout, visual hierarchy, and element placement, allowing your designer to execute the concepts quickly while maintaining the brand consistency of Wholesale BD and the stylistic references of Amazon/Daraz.

## üé® Implementation Guidance: Figma/Canva Checklist

To execute these wireframes in your preferred design tool (Figma, Canva, Sketch, etc.), follow this checklist:

1.  **Establish Grid System:** Define your desktop grid (12-column recommended) and mobile grid, and ensure all text/image splits (55/45, 40/60) snap cleanly to those columns.
2.  **Define Typography:** Set the visual style for three levels:
    *   **Level 1 (Urgency/Sale):** Bold, heavy Sans-serif (used in Slide 1).
    *   **Level 2 (Product/Utility):** Clean, standard Sans-serif (used in Slides 2, 3, 4).
    *   **Level 3 (Values/Connection):** Elegant Sans-serif or Serif (used in Slide 5).
3.  **Color Palette Integration:** Apply Wholesale BD's primary and secondary brand colors consistently, using the contrast colors (Red/Orange) only for the Flash Sale slide (Slide 1) to maximize impact.
4.  **Component Creation:** Create reusable components for the Countdown Timer, the CTA button styles (Primary, Secondary, Outline), and the Product Card template (used in Bestsellers/Category).
5.  **Responsiveness Check:** Verify that the mobile stack for each slide looks good at the 375px breakpoint and scales appropriately up to tablet size. Ensure images crop intelligently to keep the focal point visible.

These specifications give your design team clear, measurable instructions for every element on every banner, ensuring speed and accuracy in development.
