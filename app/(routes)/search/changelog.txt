Summary of Frontend Implementation
‚úÖ Core Features Completed:
New Search Page (/search):
Replaced the dummy page with a fully dynamic search results page.
It correctly parses the search query from the URL (?q=...).
Displays a "Did you mean..." suggestion when the API provides one for typos.
Renders a grid of product results using your existing ProductCard.
Handles loading, error, and "no results" states gracefully.
Personalized Discovery Feed (/profile/me):
Integrated a "For You" section into the user's personal profile page.
This section displays:
"Recently Viewed" products.
"Recommended for You" (based on favorite category) for users with activity.
"Trending Now" as a fallback for new users.
Updated Dashboard (/dashboard):
Transformed the static page into a dynamic, infographic-based portal.
Uses Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to show different data cards to Admin vs. Seller roles.
Admin View: Displays real, live data for Total Products and Total Users across the platform.
Seller View: Displays real, live data for their total number of listed products.
All Users: Displays a real-time list of their "Recent Search History".
‚öôÔ∏è Codebase Enhancements:
API Client (apiClient.ts):
Added new methods for search.getResults, search.getDiscoveryFeed, products.addTags, products.getPublicCount, users.getTotalCount, and users.getMyActivity.
Ensured all new methods correctly handle the transformation of "raw" product data into the frontend Product type (with thumbnail and previews).
Custom Hooks:
Created useSearch to manage fetching and state for the search results page.
Created useDiscoveryFeed to fetch personalized content for the profile page.
Significantly updated useDashboardStats to fetch real, role-based data and user activity.
Components:
ResponsiveSearchBar: Updated to navigate to /search?q=... on form submission, integrating it with the new search page.
Types (types.ts):
Added SearchResponse, DiscoveryResponse, and UserActivity types to match the new API responses.
Added the tags array to the Product type.
üìã Outstanding To-Dos (Future Enhancements):
Implement Pagination on the Search Page: The search results page currently shows only the first page of results. A "Load More" button or numbered pagination controls should be added to fetch subsequent pages using the page parameter in useSearch.
Make Dashboard Stats Real-Time: The "Total Sales," "New Orders," and "Pending Orders" cards on the dashboard are still using hardcoded placeholder data. This requires building new analytics endpoints on the backend.
Implement "Most Visited Pages": This infographic on the dashboard is a placeholder. A full implementation would require a backend mechanism to track page views and an API endpoint to retrieve that data.
Federated User Search: The optional feature to allow searching for users/sellers from the main search bar has been added to the to-do list.
üêû Major Errors Solved:
Backend Search Failures: We systematically debugged why the search for "phone" failed.
Problem 1: Missing Tags. Solved by adding a tags field to the Product schema and an API endpoint to manage them.
Problem 2: Dictionary Not Updating. Solved by updating the updateDictionary function to read from the new tags field.
Problem 3: MongoDB Stop Words. Diagnosed that the default text index was ignoring common words like "phone".
Problem 4: Index Not Rebuilding. Solved by abandoning the unreliable text index (due to the URI-only connection) and switching to a robust Regular Expression ($regex) search, which is now working perfectly for all terms.
Frontend 404 Not Found Error: The dashboard was failing because it was calling a /me/activity endpoint that didn't exist. Solved by building the required endpoint on the NestJS backend.
Multiple TypeScript & ESLint Errors: Corrected numerous type errors in the apiClient and custom hooks, ensuring the frontend codebase is fully type-safe and lint-free.
